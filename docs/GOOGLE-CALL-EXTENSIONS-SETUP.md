## PART 6: TEST CALL EXTENSION

### 6.1 Click-to-Call Test

**Important:** Do NOT actually make calls during testing. We just verify the link works.

1. Search on mobile device:
   - Search for: `"handyman los angeles"`
   - Your ad should appear
   - You should see: **"📞 Call" button** (not just the number)

2. **Right-click** the phone number
   - Choose: **"Copy link address"**
   - You should see: `tel:+1-213-361-1700` (or forwarding number)
   - ✅ This means the link works

3. **Alternative (don't actually call):**
   - On desktop, click phone number
   - Should prompt: "Open phone app?" or "Open FaceTime?"
   - Click **Cancel** (don't actually call)
   - ✅ This confirms the tel: link is functional

### 6.2 View Call Metrics (After 24-48 Hours)

**Once the extension has been live for a few days:**

1. Go to **Google Ads Campaigns**
2. Click your campaign: **"Handyman - Local Services"**
3. Click **Columns** dropdown
4. Add metric: **"Calls"** or **"Phone Call Conversions"**
5. View reports:
   ```
   📞 Calls: [number]
   📞 Call Duration: [avg. seconds]
   📞 Call Cost: [cost per call]
   ```

**You should see:**
- Calls metric shows how many clicks to call
- Call duration shows seconds (if >15 sec, likely a real call)
- Call attribution helps optimize keyword bids

## PART 7: OPTIONAL - ADVANCED CALL TRACKING

### 7.1 CallRail Integration (Optional, $75/mo)

For more detailed call tracking (recording, transcript, caller ID):

1. Sign up: https://www.callrail.com
2. Create account (14-day free trial)
3. Create **"Phone Number"** in CallRail
4. Get dedicated CallRail number: (844) 123-4567
5. Connect to Google Ads:
   - Google Ads → Assets → Call → Link CallRail number instead of direct
6. CallRail forwards calls to 213-361-1700

**Benefits of CallRail:**
- ✅ Call recordings (hear what customers say)
- ✅ Transcripts (read the call)
- ✅ Caller ID (know who's calling)
- ✅ Better attribution (see which ads drive calls)
- ✅ Integration with CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce)

**For now:** Skip this. Google's free call tracking is enough to start.

### 7.2 Google Call Conversion Tracking

Google automatically tracks:
- ✅ Call clicks
- ✅ Call duration (if >5 seconds = likely answered)
- ✅ Time of day
- ✅ Device (mobile/desktop)
- ✅ Keyword that triggered ad

You can mark calls as "conversions" for optimization:

1. Go to **Google Ads** → **Conversions**
2. Click **+ New Conversion**
3. Type: **Calls from ads**
4. Mark calls >30 seconds as conversion
5. Save

Now Google will optimize your ads to drive calls (instead of form fills).

## PART 8: TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue 1: Phone Number Not Showing in Ad Preview

**Check:**
1. Is call asset **Status** = "Approved"? (Wait 1-2 hours if Pending)
2. Is call asset linked to campaign? (Settings → Assets → verify it's listed)
3. Is ad itself approved? (Click on ad, check Status)
4. Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
5. Try in Incognito mode

**Fix:**
- Wait 2 hours for approval
- Re-link asset to campaign
- Check Google Ads policy violations (ads.google.com/policies)

### Issue 2: Phone Number Shows But Clicks Don't Work

**Check:**
1. Number format correct? Should be +1-213-361-1700 (or (844) XXX-XXXX)
2. Test on mobile device (click shows best on mobile)
3. Right-click number → "Copy link" → should show `tel:+1...`

**Fix:**
- Delete and recreate call asset
- Verify phone number format in asset
- Ensure Google tracking forwarding is enabled

### Issue 3: No Calls Showing in Metrics After 48 Hours

**Check:**
1. Is campaign actually running? (Status should be "Enabled")
2. Is budget applied? (Budget should show $20/day)
3. Are ads getting impressions? (Impressions > 100)
4. Are ads getting clicks? (Clicks > 5)
5. Is phone number valid and staffed 8am-8pm?

**Expected:**
- If campaign running → should get clicks
- If clicks → some should be call clicks
- If call clicks → should see in "Calls" metric

**Fix:**
- Increase daily budget ($20 → $50)
- Lower bid ($0.50 → $0.30) to get more clicks
- Expand keywords
- Check if ads are being shown (go to Search Terms report)
